Helps visualize the local income tax rates by county 

### Possible resources

* [List of Cities and Towns in the United States](https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-cities-and-towns-in-the-United-States-2023068)
* [2021 State Individual Income Tax Structures](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/state/state-income-tax-rates-2021/)
* [SOI Tax Stats](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi)

I may compile my own dataset. Which I would need the Local Income Tax Rate for every county, in every state. So far I know:
* Alaska: No Income Tax
* Florida: No Income Tax
* [Maryland](https://www.marylandtaxes.gov/individual/income/tax-info/tax-rates.php)
* Nevada: No Income Tax
* South Dakota: No Income Tax
* Tennessee: No Income Tax
* Washington: No Income Tax
